## Have You Installed Node JS?

[Step 0](suite-step-1.html) in the getting started guide walks you through the process of installing Node JS, an open-source server environment required to run Superalgos. Make sure you have installed the software correctly. Double-check in case the installation hasn't finished yet.

## Are you running the command from the correct folder?

Make sure you run the command from within the ```Superalgos-master``` folder.

## Test if Node JS is installed

Run the ```node --version``` command to test if Node JS is installed. If Node JS is installed, the system should return a version number. If it doesn't, please install Node JS again.
