market_trading_tasks: "A market trading tasks node groups trading tasks operating in a specific market."

trading_mine_tasks: "The trading mine tasks node is an organizational device that groups tasks corresponding to the referenced trading mine."

trading_bot_instance: "A trading bot instance is a reference to the trading bot as defined in the Masters data mine. The instance of the bot runs the defined processes and generates the defined data products."

trading_process_instance: "A trading process instance is a reference to the process definition of the trading bot, as defined in the Masters data mine."

backtesting_session: "A backtesting session is a trading mode by which the trading bot instance reads historic market data in a user-defined datetime range, applies the rules defined in the associated trading system, and generates a trading simulation."

paper_trading_session: "A paper trading session is a trading mode by which the trading bot instance reads a live market data feed, applies the rules defined in the associated trading system, and generates a trading simulation."

forward_testing_session: "A forward testing session is a trading mode by which the trading bot instance performs live trading with a user-defined fraction of the available capital."

live_trading_session: "A live trading session is a trading mode by which the trading bot instance reads a live market data feed, applies the rules as defined in the associated trading system, places the corresponding orders at the associated exchange, and stores the defined data products."

trading_engine_reference: "A trading engine reference determines which trading engine the trading bot shall use to structure the data it processes while running the trading session."

trading_system_reference: "A trading engine reference determines which trading system shall be evaluated by the trading bot to run the trading session."

parameters: "Parameters are properties of trading sessions, defined by users, to determine their behavior and improve the quality of simulations."

session_base_asset: "The base asset is the asset whose price is determined by the market. It is usually the first asset in the pair, as listed by the exchange."

session_quoted_asset: "The quoted asset is the asset on which the price of the base asset is denominated in the market. It is usually the second asset in the pair, as listed by the exchange."
